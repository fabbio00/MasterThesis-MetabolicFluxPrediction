# MasterThesis-MetabolicFluxPrediction
This repository contains a public overview of my MSc thesis, which focuses on predicting metabolic fluxes using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

The goal of this work was to develop a graph-based deep learning approach to estimate reaction fluxes in genome-scale metabolic models. We designed and trained a GNN model that incorporates stoichiometric information, gene expression data, and network topology.
